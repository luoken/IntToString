# IntegerToString

Simple module to convert a number from 0-9999 to its string representation. To run, `git clone` the repository and navigate to it and run `iex -S mix` to get the interactive shell up and running. When inside the interactive shell, you can call the function as such: `IntegerToString.convert_to_string(999)` and it will output the string representation.
